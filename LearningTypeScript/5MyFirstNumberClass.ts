// differences in syntax
// 1 = data type is not "string" anymore  it is a "number"
// 2 =  we do not have quatations anymore

let myFirstNuber: number = 26

//the problem is we cannot make calculations with it
// '26' + '54' = '2654
// 26 + 54 = 80

// store retirenment age
 let myRetirenmentAge: number = 60
